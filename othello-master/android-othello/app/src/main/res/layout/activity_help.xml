Each reversi piece has a black side and a white side. On your turn, you place one piece on the board with your color facing up.
You must place the piece so that an opponent's piece, or a row of opponent's pieces,
is flanked by your pieces. All of the opponent's pieces between your pieces are then turned over to become your color.    "/>
